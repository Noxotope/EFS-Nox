This is a calculator for Egg Farm Simulator on Roblox. I'm working on it quite often so expect frequent changes. If you have any suggestions of what I should add to the code or ways to make it shorter, etc. I'll take ALL suggestions into consideration. I hope this helps with the game and yes, this is my first program I've ever created.
To use the calculator, go to a website that has a built in IDE such as repl.it and just copy and paste the code into the IDE.
*Note that the equations used in this calculator have all been sources from the EFS wiki and NOT Life's calculator. If you would like proof then please contact me on discord @ Noxotope#0262.
